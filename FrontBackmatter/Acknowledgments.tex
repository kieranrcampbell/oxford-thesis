\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First and foremost I would like to thank Chris Yau for his wonderful supervision during my DPhil. 
He has taught me an incredible amount about statistics, genomics, and academic life in general, and in both our work and my plans in life he has encouraged me to go a level beyond that I would have before. On the rare occasion I'm convinced I've found a flaw in his thinking I'm swiftly proven wrong. I would also like to thank him for sending me to DisneyWorld.

I would like to thank Caleb Webber for...

I am indebted to Chris Ponting for our early discussions, but also his mentorship throughout my DPhil and continued advice in planning my future beyond these studies.

I'm also grateful to those with whom I've collaborated with scientifically both in Oxford and further afield. Davis McCarthy and Quin Wills on the development of Scater, Charmaine Laing on the Parkinson's project, Georg Holl{\"a}nder and Carlos Mayer on the Thymus project, and many others.
Funding

Friends in Oxford

I am deeply thankful to my parents for their love and support through 21 (!) continuous years of education.

Sally
