                 such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high
                 variability in gene expression between individual cells.
                 Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have
                 difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a
                 transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of
                 cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori
                 knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe
                 Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal
                 resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq
                 data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the
                 differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed
                 switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors,
                 sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of
                 regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We
                 validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of
                 function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover

                 represented as distinctive cell subsets. A continuum of
                 transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages.

                 single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that

                 lineage biases. The results were robust with respect to
                 experimental platform differences between RT-PCR and RNA
                 sequencing. We selectively tested our predictions in Nanog
                 mutants and found good agreement between SCUBA predictions and
                 the experimental data. We further extended the utility of
                 SCUBA by developing a method to reconstruct missing
                 temporal-order information from a typical single-cell dataset.
                 Analysis of a hematopoietic dataset suggests that our method
                 is effective for reconstructing gene expression dynamics
                 during human B-cell development. In summary, SCUBA provides a
                 useful single-cell data analysis tool that is well-suited for
                 the investigation of developmental processes.",

  abstract    = "When analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data, constructing a
                 pseudo-temporal path to order cells based on the gradual
                 transition of their transcriptomes is a useful way to study
                 gene expression dynamics in a heterogeneous cell population.
                 Currently, a limited number of computational tools are
                 available for this task, and quantitative methods for
                 comparing different tools are lacking. Tools for Single Cell
                 Analysis (TSCAN) is a software tool developed to better
                 support in silico pseudo-Time reconstruction in Single-Cell
                 RNA-seq ANalysis. TSCAN uses a cluster-based minimum spanning
                 tree (MST) approach to order cells. Cells are first grouped
                 into clusters and an MST is then constructed to connect
                 cluster centers. Pseudo-time is obtained by projecting each
                 cell onto the tree, and the ordered sequence of cells can be
                 used to study dynamic changes of gene expression along the
                 pseudo-time. Clustering cells before MST construction reduces
                 the complexity of the tree space. This often leads to improved
                 cell ordering. It also allows users to conveniently adjust the
                 ordering based on prior knowledge. TSCAN has a graphical user
                 interface (GUI) to support data visualization and user
                 interaction. Furthermore, quantitative measures are developed
                 to objectively evaluate and compare different pseudo-time
                 reconstruction methods. TSCAN is available at

                 individuals. These samples are often snapshots of the
                 progression of a certain disease such as cancer. This raises
                 an intriguing question: Can we determine a temporal order for
                 these samples? Such an ordering can lead to better
                 understanding of the dynamics of the disease and to the
                 identification of genes associated with its progression. In
                 this paper we formally prove, for the first time, that under a
                 model for the dynamics of the expression levels of a single
                 gene, it is indeed possible to recover the correct ordering of
                 the static expression datasets by solving an instance of the
                 traveling salesman problem (TSP). In addition, we devise an
                 algorithm that combines a TSP heuristic and probabilistic
                 modeling for inferring the underlying temporal order of the
                 microarray experiments. This algorithm constructs
                 probabilistic continuous curves to represent expression

                 data. Applying our method to cancer expression data we show
                 that the ordering derived agrees well with survival duration.
                 A classifier that utilizes this ordering improves upon other
                 classifiers suggested for this task. The set of genes
                 displaying consistent behavior for the determined ordering are

                 difficult to estimate due to problems of synchronization,
                 temporal sampling and rate heterogeneity. Methods are needed
                 that can utilize multi-dimensional data, such as those
                 resulting from DNA microarray experiments, in order to
                 reconstruct time series from unordered or poorly ordered sets
                 of observations. RESULTS: We present a set of algorithms for
                 estimating temporal orderings from unordered sets of sample
                 elements. The techniques we describe are based on
                 modifications of a minimum-spanning tree calculated from a
                 weighted, undirected graph. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
                 approach by applying these techniques to an artificial data
                 set as well as several gene expression data sets derived from
                 DNA microarray experiments. In addition to estimating
                 orderings, the techniques we describe also provide useful
                 heuristics for assessing relevant properties of sample
                 datasets such as noise and sampling intensity, and we show how
                 a data structure called a PQ-tree can be used to represent
                 uncertainty in a reconstructed ordering. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract    = "In biological systems that undergo processes such as
                 differentiation, a clear concept of progression exists. We
                 present a novel computational approach, called Sample
                 Progression Discovery (SPD), to discover patterns of
                 biological progression underlying microarray gene expression
                 data. SPD assumes that individual samples of a microarray
                 dataset are related by an unknown biological process (i.e.,
                 differentiation, development, cell cycle, disease
                 progression), and that each sample represents one unknown
                 point along the progression of that process. SPD aims to
                 organize the samples in a manner that reveals the underlying
                 progression and to simultaneously identify subsets of genes
                 that are responsible for that progression. We demonstrate the
                 performance of SPD on a variety of microarray datasets that
                 were generated by sampling a biological process at different
                 points along its progression, without providing SPD any
                 information of the underlying process. When applied to a cell
                 cycle time series microarray dataset, SPD was not provided any
                 prior knowledge of samples' time order or of which genes are
                 cell-cycle regulated, yet SPD recovered the correct time order
                 and identified many genes that have been associated with the
                 cell cycle. When applied to B-cell differentiation data, SPD
                 recovered the correct order of stages of normal B-cell
                 differentiation and the linkage between preB-ALL tumor cells
                 with their cell origin preB. When applied to mouse embryonic
                 stem cell differentiation data, SPD uncovered a landscape of
                 ESC differentiation into various lineages and genes that
                 represent both generic and lineage specific processes. When
                 applied to a prostate cancer microarray dataset, SPD
                 identified gene modules that reflect a progression consistent
                 with disease stages. SPD may be best viewed as a novel tool
                 for synthesizing biological hypotheses because it provides a
                 likely biological progression underlying a microarray dataset
                 and, perhaps more importantly, the candidate genes that
                 regulate that progression.",
