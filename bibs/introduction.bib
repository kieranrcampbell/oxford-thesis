                 such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high
                 variability in gene expression between individual cells.
                 Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have
                 difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a
                 transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of
                 cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori
                 knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe
                 Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal
                 resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq
                 data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the
                 differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed
                 switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors,
                 sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of
                 regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We
                 validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of
                 function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover

                 represented as distinctive cell subsets. A continuum of
                 transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages.

                 single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that

                 experimental platform differences between RT-PCR and RNA
                 sequencing. We selectively tested our predictions in Nanog
                 mutants and found good agreement between SCUBA predictions and

                 SCUBA by developing a method to reconstruct missing
                 temporal-order information from a typical single-cell dataset.
                 Analysis of a hematopoietic dataset suggests that our method
                 is effective for reconstructing gene expression dynamics
                 during human B-cell development. In summary, SCUBA provides a

                 pseudo-temporal path to order cells based on the gradual
                 transition of their transcriptomes is a useful way to study
                 gene expression dynamics in a heterogeneous cell population.
                 Currently, a limited number of computational tools are
                 available for this task, and quantitative methods for
                 comparing different tools are lacking. Tools for Single Cell
                 Analysis (TSCAN) is a software tool developed to better
                 support in silico pseudo-Time reconstruction in Single-Cell
                 RNA-seq ANalysis. TSCAN uses a cluster-based minimum spanning
                 tree (MST) approach to order cells. Cells are first grouped
                 into clusters and an MST is then constructed to connect
                 cluster centers. Pseudo-time is obtained by projecting each
                 cell onto the tree, and the ordered sequence of cells can be
                 used to study dynamic changes of gene expression along the
                 pseudo-time. Clustering cells before MST construction reduces
                 the complexity of the tree space. This often leads to improved
                 cell ordering. It also allows users to conveniently adjust the
                 ordering based on prior knowledge. TSCAN has a graphical user
                 interface (GUI) to support data visualization and user
                 interaction. Furthermore, quantitative measures are developed

                 individuals. These samples are often snapshots of the
                 progression of a certain disease such as cancer. This raises
                 an intriguing question: Can we determine a temporal order for
                 these samples? Such an ordering can lead to better
                 understanding of the dynamics of the disease and to the
                 identification of genes associated with its progression. In
                 this paper we formally prove, for the first time, that under a
                 model for the dynamics of the expression levels of a single
                 gene, it is indeed possible to recover the correct ordering of
                 the static expression datasets by solving an instance of the

                 difficult to estimate due to problems of synchronization,
                 temporal sampling and rate heterogeneity. Methods are needed
                 that can utilize multi-dimensional data, such as those
                 resulting from DNA microarray experiments, in order to
                 reconstruct time series from unordered or poorly ordered sets
                 of observations. RESULTS: We present a set of algorithms for
                 estimating temporal orderings from unordered sets of sample
                 elements. The techniques we describe are based on
                 modifications of a minimum-spanning tree calculated from a
                 weighted, undirected graph. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
                 approach by applying these techniques to an artificial data
                 set as well as several gene expression data sets derived from
                 DNA microarray experiments. In addition to estimating
                 orderings, the techniques we describe also provide useful
                 heuristics for assessing relevant properties of sample
                 datasets such as noise and sampling intensity, and we show how
                 a data structure called a PQ-tree can be used to represent

                 differentiation, a clear concept of progression exists. We
                 present a novel computational approach, called Sample
                 Progression Discovery (SPD), to discover patterns of
                 biological progression underlying microarray gene expression
                 data. SPD assumes that individual samples of a microarray
                 dataset are related by an unknown biological process (i.e.,
                 differentiation, development, cell cycle, disease
                 progression), and that each sample represents one unknown
                 point along the progression of that process. SPD aims to
                 organize the samples in a manner that reveals the underlying
                 progression and to simultaneously identify subsets of genes
                 that are responsible for that progression. We demonstrate the
                 performance of SPD on a variety of microarray datasets that
                 were generated by sampling a biological process at different
                 points along its progression, without providing SPD any
                 information of the underlying process. When applied to a cell
                 cycle time series microarray dataset, SPD was not provided any
                 prior knowledge of samples' time order or of which genes are
                 cell-cycle regulated, yet SPD recovered the correct time order
                 and identified many genes that have been associated with the
                 cell cycle. When applied to B-cell differentiation data, SPD
                 recovered the correct order of stages of normal B-cell
                 differentiation and the linkage between preB-ALL tumor cells
                 with their cell origin preB. When applied to mouse embryonic
                 stem cell differentiation data, SPD uncovered a landscape of
                 ESC differentiation into various lineages and genes that
                 represent both generic and lineage specific processes. When
                 applied to a prostate cancer microarray dataset, SPD
                 identified gene modules that reflect a progression consistent
                 with disease stages. SPD may be best viewed as a novel tool
                 for synthesizing biological hypotheses because it provides a
                 likely biological progression underlying a microarray dataset
                 and, perhaps more importantly, the candidate genes that

                 could be identified using few cells per cell type. Applying
                 Smart-Seq to circulating tumor cells from melanomas, we

                 candidate biomarkers for melanoma circulating tumor cells. Our

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The advent of high throughput RNA-seq at the
                 single-cell level has opened up new opportunities to elucidate
                 the heterogeneity of gene expression. One of the most
                 widespread applications of RNA-seq is to identify genes which
                 are differentially expressed between two experimental
                 conditions. RESULTS: We present a discrete, distributional
                 method for differential gene expression (D(3)E), a novel
                 algorithm specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data.
                 We use synthetic data to evaluate D(3)E, demonstrating that it
                 can detect changes in expression, even when the mean level
                 remains unchanged. Since D(3)E is based on an analytically
                 tractable stochastic model, it provides additional biological
                 insights by quantifying biologically meaningful properties,
                 such as the average burst size and frequency. We use D(3)E to
                 investigate experimental data, and with the help of the
                 underlying model, we directly test hypotheses about the
                 driving mechanism behind changes in gene expression.
                 CONCLUSION: Evaluation using synthetic data shows that D(3)E
                 performs better than other methods for identifying
                 differentially expressed genes since it is designed to take
                 full advantage of the information available from single-cell
                 RNA-seq experiments. Moreover, the analytical model underlying
                 D(3)E makes it possible to gain additional biological
                 insights.",

  abstract    = "Understanding the development and function of an organ
                 requires the characterization of all of its cell types.
                 Traditional methods for visualizing and isolating
                 subpopulations of cells are based on messenger RNA or protein
                 expression of only a few known marker genes. The unequivocal
                 identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a
                 major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare.
                 Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived
                 progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumour cells,
                 is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or
                 diseased tissue biology. To address this challenge we first
                 sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly selected
                 cells from mouse intestinal organoids, cultured
                 self-organizing epithelial structures that contain all cell
                 lineages of the mammalian intestine. Organoid buds, like
                 intestinal crypts, harbour stem cells that continuously
                 differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at
                 widely different abundances. Since available computational
                 methods can only resolve more abundant cell types, we
                 developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type
                 identification in complex populations of single cells. We
                 demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve cell types
                 represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly
                 sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4
                 as a novel marker for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population
                 of hormone-producing intestinal cells. Next, we use Reg4
                 expression to enrich for these rare cells and investigate the
                 heterogeneity within this population. RaceID confirmed the
                 existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover
                 discovered novel subtypes, which we subsequently validated in
                 vivo. Having validated RaceID we then applied the algorithm to
                 ex vivo-isolated Lgr5-positive stem cells and their direct
                 progeny. We find that Lgr5-positive cells represent a
                 homogenous abundant population of stem cells mixed with a rare
                 population of Lgr5-positive secretory cells. We envision broad
                 applicability of our method for discovering rare cell types
                 and the corresponding marker genes in healthy and diseased

                 regulation in thousands of individual cells in a single
                 experiment. Such experiments will allow us to discover new

                 They overcome fundamental limitations inherent in measurements
                 of bulk cell population that have frustrated efforts to
                 resolve cellular states. Single-cell genomics and proteomics
                 enable not only precise characterization of cell state, but
                 also provide a stunningly high-resolution view of transitions
                 between states. These measurements may finally make explicit
                 the metaphor that C.H. Waddington posed nearly 60 years ago to
                 explain cellular plasticity: Cells are residents of a vast

                 helps not only locate cells on this landscape, but illuminates
                 the molecular mechanisms that shape the landscape itself.
