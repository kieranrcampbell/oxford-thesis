@article{Law2014-tu,
	Abstract = {New normal linear modeling strategies are presented for analyzing
              read counts from RNA-seq experiments. The voom method estimates
              the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a
              precision weight for each observation and enters these into the
              limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This opens access for
              RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology developed for
              microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom performs as well
              or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are
              generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods.
              Two case studies illustrate the use of linear modeling and gene
              set testing methods.},
