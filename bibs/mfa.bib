  abstract    = "Cells, the basic units of biological structure and function,
                 vary broadly in type and state. Single-cell genomics can
                 characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of
                 ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we
                 describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands
                 of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized
                 aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each
                 cell's RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq
                 analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells
                 simultaneously while remembering transcripts' cell of origin.
                 We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and
                 identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations,
                 creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known
                 retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes.
                 Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling
                 routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution.
