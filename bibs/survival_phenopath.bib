                   categories or stages based on well-characterized clinical
                   markers. However, such a system is potentially at odds with
                   our understanding of the underlying biology, which in highly
                   complex systems may support a (near-)continuous evolution of
                   disease from inception to terminal state. To learn such a
                   continuous disease score one could infer a latent variable
                   from dynamic ``omics'' data such as RNA-seq that correlates
                   with an outcome of interest such as survival time. However,
                   such analyses may be confounded by additional data such as
                   clinical covariates measured in electronic health records

                   variable models, a novel type of latent variable model that
                   learns a low-dimensional data representation in the presence
                   of two (asymmetric) views of the same data source. We apply
                   our model to TCGA colorectal cancer RNA-seq data and
                   demonstrate how incorporating microsatellite-instability
                   (MSI) status as an external covariate allows us to identify
                   genes that stratify patients on an immune-response
                   trajectory. Finally, we propose an extension termed

                 external studies, making clinical application problematic. We

                 tumors, from a cohort representative of the demographics of
                 breast cancer. Using a recently proposed semisupervised
                 method, we identified a prognostic signature of 70 genes that
                 significantly correlated with survival (hazard ratio (HR):
                 5.97, 95\% confidence interval: 3.0-11.9, P = 2.7e-07). In

                 of other standard prognostic classifiers such as the
                 Nottingham Prognostic Index and the 'Adjuvant!' software.
                 Using two different prognostic classification schemes and
                 measures, nearest centroid (HR) and risk ordering (D-index),

                 mRNA in different cancers as well as in different populations
                 or subtypes of same cancer. DESCRIPTION: We have created a web
                 application that can be used for studying prognostic
                 implications of mRNA biomarkers in a variety of cancers. We
                 have compiled data from public repositories such as GEO, EBI
                 Array Express and The Cancer Genome Atlas for creating this
                 tool. With 64 patient series from 18 cancer types in our

                 identify potential prognostic mRNA biomarkers to follow up
                 with further research. For this reason, we have kept the web

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Currently, prognostication for pancreatic ductal
                 adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is based upon a coarse clinical staging
                 system. Thus, more accurate prognostic tests are needed for
                 PDAC patients to aid treatment decisions. METHODS AND
                 FINDINGS: Affymetrix gene expression profiling was carried out
                 on 15 human PDAC tumors and from the data we identified a
                 13-gene expression signature (risk score) that correlated with
                 patient survival. The gene expression risk score was then
                 independently validated using published gene expression data
                 and survival data for an additional 101 patients with
                 pancreatic cancer. Patients with high-risk scores had
                 significantly higher risk of death compared to patients with
                 low-risk scores (HR 2.27, p = 0.002). When the 13-gene score
                 was combined with lymph node status the risk-score further
                 discriminated the length of patient survival time (p<0.001).
                 Patients with a high-risk score had poor survival independent
                 of nodal status; however, nodal status increased
                 predictability for survival in patients with a low-risk gene
                 signature score (low-risk N1 vs. low-risk N0: HR = 2.0, p =
                 0.002). While AJCC stage correlated with patient survival (p =
                 0.03), the 13-gene score was superior at predicting survival.
                 Of the 13 genes comprising the predictive model, four have
                 been shown to be important in PDAC, six are unreported in PDAC
                 but important in other cancers, and three are unreported in
                 any cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a 13-gene expression
                 signature that predicts survival of PDAC patients and could
                 prove useful for making treatment decisions. This risk score
                 should be evaluated prospectively in clinical trials for
                 prognostication and for predicting response to chemotherapy.
                 Investigation of new genes identified in our model may lead to
                 novel therapeutic targets.",

                 such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high
                 variability in gene expression between individual cells.
                 Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have
                 difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a
                 transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of
                 cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori
                 knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe
                 Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal
                 resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq
                 data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the
                 differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed
                 switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors,
                 sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of
                 regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We
                 validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of
                 function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover
                 single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of

                 transcriptional dynamics in temporal processes, such as cell
                 differentiation, using computational methods to label each
                 cell with a 'pseudotime' where true time series
                 experimentation is too difficult to perform. However, owing to
                 the high variability in gene expression between individual
                 cells, there is an inherent uncertainty in the precise
                 temporal ordering of the cells. Pre-existing methods for
                 pseudotime estimation have predominantly given point estimates
                 precluding a rigorous analysis of the implications of
                 uncertainty. We use probabilistic modelling techniques to
                 quantify pseudotime uncertainty and propagate this into

                 data confound several sources of variation, with contributions
                 from measurement noise, stochastic cell-to-cell variation and
                 cell progression at different rates. Time series from single
                 cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the
                 measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When
                 several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be
                 estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness
                 assumptions on cell progression. RESULTS: We present a
                 principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference
                 scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method's
                 utility on public microarray, nCounter and RNA-seq datasets
                 from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers
                 withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis dataset, it
                 accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate
                 cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious
                 cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic
                 cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with
                 Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. We also show using
                 held-out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a
                 common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of
                 repeated cross-sectional time series. AVAILABILITY AND
